## Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

To run the program, you need to have `bun` in your system. If you don't have it, you can follow the instructions [here](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

Install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
bun install
```

To test the program, you can use the following command, which will run the tests against the dataset in the `test/data` directory:

```bash
bun test
```
